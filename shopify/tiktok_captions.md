Content Notes:
LIGHTING: Current harsh overhead fluorescent lighting creates unflattering shadows. Recommend soft natural daylight or ring light setup for even illumination.

BACKGROUND: Plain white wall with visible electrical outlets and pipes detracts from product. Use a clean backdrop (fabric/paper) or style in an aesthetic setting.

ANGLES: Add close-up shots of embroidery detail, back view, and side profile. Current video only shows front view.

STYLING: Display on a live model if possible to show drape and movement. Add complementary accessories (hijab, belt, jewelry).

VIDEO QUALITY: Slight shakiness - use tripod for stability. Slow pan movements would highlight the embroidery better.

HIGHLIGHT: Focus more camera time on the beautiful trim details - this is the selling point.

Content Notes:
LIGHTING: Close-up shots are well-lit showing embroidery detail. Maintain this lighting quality throughout.

FOCUS: Some frames are slightly blurry - ensure camera focuses properly before recording. The detail shots need crisp clarity to showcase craftsmanship.

COMPOSITION: Great embroidery close-ups! Add full garment shots to show overall design and silhouette.

BACKGROUND: Hand/fingers visible in frame - use a flat lay setup or mannequin for product-focused shots.

CONTENT SUGGESTION: Create a "zoom in" style video starting from full view then dramatically zooming into embroidery details.

AUDIO: Add trending sounds or soft background music to increase engagement.

Soft colors, intricate details, modest coverage - the trifecta 
#ModestLook #FloralEmbroidery #SoftAesthetic #ModernModest #KurtaLove

Content Notes:
LIGHTING: Good natural light showing embroidery texture. The contrast between embroidered and printed sections is visible.

COMPOSITION: Excellent detail shots of embroidery. Need full-length shots showing complete garment silhouette and neckline detail.

BACKGROUND: Mannequin display is good but background appears cluttered. Use cleaner setting.

FOCUS: Some motion blur in certain frames - stabilize camera for clearer shots.

STYLING SUGGESTION: Show the scalloped neckline as a featured close-up. This is a unique selling point.

ADDITIONAL CONTENT: Include shots of the fabric flowing/moving to demonstrate quality and drape.

Content Notes:
LIGHTING: Indoor lighting appears adequate but could benefit from additional front-facing light to reduce shadows.

BACKGROUND: Basic workshop/studio setting visible. Upgrade to lifestyle setting or clean backdrop for social media appeal.

ANGLES: Good coverage of embroidery details. Include full-length shot and back view to show complete design.

VIDEO STABILITY: Some movement detected - use tripod for smoother footage.

STYLING: Consider showing the tunic styled as a complete outfit with accessories and bottoms.

UNIQUE SELLING POINT: The vibrant coral-mint color combination is striking - ensure color accuracy in filming (avoid yellow-tinted lighting).

#ModestWardrobe #EmbroideredStyle #ModernModest #KaftanStyle #SpecialOccasion

Content Notes:
LIGHTING: Image is quite dark - the rich plum color needs better lighting to show true vibrancy. Use bright, diffused lighting.

COMPOSITION: Photo shows only partial garment/fabric detail. Need full garment shot showing silhouette and length.

BACKGROUND: Not visible in this close-up. When shooting full garment, use complementary backdrop (cream, gold, or neutral).

FOCUS: Good detail capture of embroidery pattern. Maintain this sharpness for all shots.

STYLING RECOMMENDATION: This piece deserves premium presentation - consider flat lay with gold accessories or on model with elegant styling.

ADDITIONAL SHOTS NEEDED: Full front view, back detail, neckline close-up, and fabric drape demonstration.

#ModernModest #ModestLook #NeutralTones #EmbroideredAbaya #TimelessFashion

Content Notes:
LIGHTING: Natural daylight appears harsh with overexposed areas. Use diffused lighting for even exposure.

BACKGROUND: Very cluttered with other fabrics/garments visible. This significantly diminishes product presentation. Use clean, uncluttered backdrop.

COMPOSITION: Garment appears wrinkled - steam before photographing. Current angle makes it hard to see full silhouette.

STYLING: Display on mannequin properly or flat lay with the garment smoothed and arranged elegantly.

FOCUS: Image is clear but composition needs work to highlight the product properly.

CRITICAL IMPROVEMENT: This beautiful piece deserves professional presentation. Current photo undermines product quality. Reshoot recommended with proper staging.
